\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
Taken most broadly, this small book combines ideas from the disciplines of differential geometry and 3D computer graphics. The core concepts in differential geometry date back to original work by Gauss in the early 19th century, whereas, of course, computer graphics is a product of the late 20th century.\\

More specifically, we draw on ideas from disciplines including topology, set theory, complex analysis, computational geometry, and image analysis.
We make extensive use of concepts and data structures from computer graphics, especially in computations.\\

Chapter 1 covers the theory of surface curvature from first principles. Chapter 2 focuses on surface curvature computation given discrete data.\\
